nothing to say really...
so here it is!
our first intro:

-nothing and more-

it was coded in quite
a hurry, so please dont
judge too hard.

anyway, we were busy
with 3d-engine and
s3m-player, so there
was not much time
left for the effects.

still, we wanted to
release something, just
to introduce ourselves.
